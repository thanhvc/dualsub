No, you don't.
I just saw you go in there with Monica.

Well, we're hanging out in here.

Which one of us is gonna be
having sex in there? Me or you?

182

Well, I suppose I would have to say you.

- What if we're watching a movie in here?
MONICA: Which we are.

184
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,520
And we've already paid for it.
It's My Giant.

My Giant? I love that movie.

186

You really think this is okay?

Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.

This is the honeymoon suite.

The room expects sex.

194
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,470
The room would be disappointed
if it didn't get sex.

195
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,723
All the other honeymoon suites
would think it was a loser.

Okay.

- Nope. Not under here.

- No, I've looked everywhere.

or else you would've found her.

- Yeah. For about, uh, 30 minutes?

Or 45?

202
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,583
Wow, in 45 minutes,
you could find her twice.

00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,589
No. For all I know,
she's trying to find me...

204

I kept moving around.

Well, I don't know, Ross. Really?

345
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,615
Yeah, yeah. It'd be great.
I mean, you can...

346
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,158
You can lay on the beach...

347
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,912
...and I can cry over my failed marriage.

348
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,706
- You see how I make jokes?
- Uh-huh.

349
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,625
Really. I mean...

350
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,044
God, I could use a friend.

351
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,881
Oh, wow. Okay, maybe.

352
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,424
Um...

353
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,635
Yes, I can do that.

354
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,513
- Cool.
RACHEL: All right, cool.

355
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,600
Okay, we're going to Greece. Yeah, okay.

356
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,769
Aah, aah. I forgot my jacket.

357
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,230
- Well, you tell them to wait.
- Okay.

358
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,482
- Wait. Wait.
- Okay.

359
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,155
Emily.

360
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,161
Oh, no, no, no.

361
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,915
No! No!

362
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,709
Emily!

363
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,506
Ah, yes. I will have a glass
of the Merlot...

364
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,384
...and he will have a white-wine spritzer.

365
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,639
Whoo!

366
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,016
Huh.

367
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,351
Hey, look at that. The airport's moving.

368
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,979
Hey, are we moving?

369
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,315
Are we moving? Why are we moving?

370
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,566
They... Um...

371
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,861
Yeah, does the captain know
that we're moving?

372
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,530
Oh, my gosh.
